# Artist Biography: Nikola Vudrag

> Born 1989, Croatia.
> Specialization: Sculpture, Medallic Art, Monumental Public Works.

## The Origins
Raised amidst the forges and workshops of his family's metalworking legacy, Vudrag developed an early bond with metal's transformative power. His education at the Academy of Applied Arts in Rijeka and the Academy of Fine Arts in Zagreb—enriched by studies in art therapy and medal-making—fostered an innovative approach to materials that blends technical rigor with psychological depth.

## The Philosophy: "Net-Work"
Vudrag's signature method begins with piles of short steel rods—mute, identical fragments. Through a ritual of up to 20,000 welds, he transforms these industrial units into organic lattices.
*   **The Process:** "Each weld is executed as a single, mindful breath."
*   **The Form:** An austere primary form (sphere, amphora) that dissolves into an organic lattice.
*   **The Metaphor:** A single droplet becomes a model of quantum entanglement; the calculated framework testifies to humanity's hunger for perfection, while the wandering infill celebrates our fallibility.

## Medallic Mastery
A rare craft combining centuries-old techniques with cutting-edge technology. Vudrag is a master medalist for the Croatian National Bank, creating the national side of Croatia's euro coins. His micro-realism is achieved through traditional hand-engraving, often on reliefs not exceeding 1.2mm.

## Monumental Works
Vudrag's practice extends to massive spatial interventions, including:
*   **Tesla Powerline:** The world's largest Nikola Tesla sculpture (12m), rendered as a functioning powerline pylon.
*   **Gardens of the Hesperides:** A 5-meter Atlas figure in Rovinj, supporting the building itself.
*   **Our Lady:** A 17-meter concrete and mosaic Madonna.

*"In a culture of infinite replication, each net-work stands as an absolute original—time's irreplicable signature welded into steel."*
