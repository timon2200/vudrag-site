# Vudrag Works — Content Drafts

## 1. NET-WORK (General)
Vudrag's signature "net-work" technique transcends mere construction, evolving into an organic growth of form. A staggering assembly of 4,000 to 20,000 individual elements, each piece is meticulously crafted through a laborious process of welding one segment after another. This method—akin to a meditative journey—requires immense patience and unwavering persistence. The result is a series of unique sculptures, each boasting a distinctive pattern that sets it apart as a singular work of art, unachievable through replication. The intricate mesh invites observers to pause and contemplate, while the interplay of light and shadow creates a dynamic visual experience that deepens with every glance.

## 2. PERSONA
**Dimensions:** 120 x 90 x 50 cm | **Year:** 2022

Derived from the Latin *persona*—meaning "mask," as in the role played by an actor—the "Persona" series confronts the architecture of human personality. Composed of 3,000 to 5,000 small CorTen rods, each cut to three centimeters and welded into a net, these works are chemically rusted and sealed with high-gloss varnish. The sculpture suggests that a "person" is neither the player nor the living being, but the role itself. It is a structure of perception, a mask that has solidified into identity.

---

## 3. VITREOLUM
**Dimensions:** 120 x 90 x 40 cm | **Year:** 2023

A face emerges from a web of iron bars—stern, noble, frozen in rigid geometry. The more we study its lines, the more it escapes us; the harder we seek its humanity, the more it reveals itself as pure structure. Perhaps all identity is a kind of cage: the bars of lineage, history, and the roles we are forged into. *Vitreolum* does not ask to be known, only to be witnessed. It is both mask and revelation, its hollow eyes reminding us that every face we see, even our own, is a scaffold of perceptions waiting to be dismantled. It is the mask in a play where no one knows the actor.

---

## 4. THE RELIC
**Dimensions:** 120 x 90 x 50 cm | **Year:** 2022

Before us stands a face—universal, classical, a relic of antiquity. Its form is familiar: the noble brow, the composed lips, the gaze that seems to look through time. Yet it is both presence and absence. The face is there, yet we see through it; its substance is openness, its solidity an illusion of intersecting lines. Tradition, too, is like this: a structure we perceive as whole, yet built from countless fragments of thought, belief, and memory. The steel does not hide its making; every weld is visible, every joint a testament to labor. The face endures not despite its transparency, but because of it—a relic that refuses to be static, a symbol that admits its own construction.

---

## 5. MEMENTO MORI
**Dimensions:** 120 x 90 x 50 cm | **Year:** 2022

This matte black sculpture, composed of delicately welded metal bars, forms an organic mesh that plays with perception and presence. The intricate meshwork creates a semi-transparent effect, allowing the white wall behind to become an active participant: shadows and lights weave through the voids to complete the portrait. This interplay of solid and empty space challenges the boundaries of form, making the sculpture appear both tangible and ephemeral. As the ambient light shifts, so does the expression, inviting viewers to contemplate the elusive nature of identity and the unseen forces that shape it. A dialogue between material and absence, this piece transforms the wall into a canvas of fleeting impressions.

---

## 6. THE GUARDIAN
**Dimensions:** 120 x 90 x 40 cm | **Year:** 2025

This arresting face, densely formed from metal bars, carries a striking duality: both fortress and figure. The steel is layered, welded with such intensity that the negative spaces nearly vanish, as if the material itself has coalesced into a protective mask. Heavy, raw, and unyielding, it speaks of resilience, yet the contours flow with an unexpected grace, softening into something almost tender. Here, metal is more than material; it becomes persona, a shield guarding the unseen vitality within. The contrast between rugged industrial weight and delicate human form invites warning: What lies behind this armored visage? Perhaps the answer is not in the steel, but in the quiet energy it contains.

---

## 7. THE PRESENCE (MADONNA AND THE VEIL)
**Dimensions:** 190 x 107 x 49 cm | **Year:** 2025

With this work, Vudrag challenges the very nature of perception through an intricate sculpture composed of 25,000 individually welded metal bars. These delicate strands coalesce into a transparent veil, an ethereal mesh that simultaneously conceals and reveals the soft, graceful contours of a face. The visage emerges not as a solid form, but as an elusive suggestion—a play of light and shadow. The veil itself cascades downward like a metaphysical drapery, both masking and mapping the anatomy beneath.

**Concept: Madonna and the Veil**
In a reverent remembrance of Madonna (Maryam), Vudrag confronts the dilemma of depicting divinity. Instead of crafting a perfect portrayal, he places a veil where the visage would be, making absence the locus of presence. The cloth of mystery both shields and reveals. By refusing to show what cannot be shown, he invites the viewer to experience the un-showable. In hiding her expression, the veil also speaks to the universal maternal anxiety—the quiet dread of a mother watching her child walk toward an uncertain destiny.

---

## 8. AMAZONA
**Dimensions:** 210 x 90 x 50 cm | **Year:** 2022

Evoking the organic complexity of the Amazon’s tangled branches and winding rivers, this metal sculpture carries the weight of time in its dark, rusted patina. Two distinct yet harmonious forms emerge—flowing like water, branching like trees—converging into a visage that feels both ancient and alive. Though the two halves never touch, their interplay suggests an unbroken connection, a silent dialogue between land and river, past and present. Mounted as a wall relief, the piece becomes a fragment of a larger, unseen landscape, inviting contemplation on the enduring forces of nature and the fragile balance within it.

---

## 9. IRON MAIDEN & THE LAST IRON MAIDEN
Two works from the same lineage, blurring the lines between painting and sculpture.

**Iron Maiden (2022)**
*170 x 90 x 45 cm*
First exhibited in Paris, this series creates a semi-transparent, organic form where shadows and light complete the portrait. A fusion of industrial rigor and poetic fragility, it remains a testament to the power of negative space.

**The Last Iron Maiden (2025)**
*120 x 90 x 40 cm*
In this culminating work, Vudrag welds thousands of heavy steel rods into a single, breathing visage. Heat-treated like a phoenix, the steel reveals hidden colors—deep charcoal shadows and polished weld peaks that catch stray light. It is the densest, most saturated piece in the series, standing as the artist's maximal declaration of metal's own truth.

---

## 10. FRAGMENTS
**Dimensions:** Various (45cm – 100cm) | **Year:** 2024–2025

**Eye**
From the *Fragments* series, "Eye" embodies the idea that beauty and meaning can emerge from brokenness. These fragmented compositions evoke resilience and transformation, encouraging a closer look to reveal intricate details and hidden connections that might otherwise go unnoticed. It is a celebration of the incomplete and the beautifully imperfect nature of existence.

**Kiss**
*120 x 50 x 15 cm, 2024.*
A wall relief crafted from 1,000 to 1,200 metal elements, *Kiss* is available in three distinct finishes: metallic shine, patinated rust, and matte rust. Exploring the timeless theme of love, it parallels the *Persona* series but delves deeper into the complexities of emotional identity, making it a significant addition to contemporary art discussions.

---

## 11. SPHERE
**Dimensions:** 40 x 40 x 50 cm | **Year:** 2025

The sphere is a symbol of perfection: eternal, whole, a shape without beginning or end. Yet here, constructed from slender metal bars, it does not seek to capture flawless form, but to reveal a hidden truth: that wholeness is an illusion, a fragile harmony of fragments. Each bar is a decision, a limitation, a defiance of the infinite curve. The gaps between them are not absences, but invitations for light to pass and for the eye to complete what the hand left open. The artist builds his sphere in fragments, honoring the paradox that only through imperfection can perfection be glimpsed.

---

## 12. AMPHORA
**Dimensions:** 80 x 33 x 33 cm | **Year:** 2025

The sacred vessel of antiquity, born from Mediterranean earth and fire, once carried wine, oil, and the whispers of forgotten voyages. Reimagined in welded metal bars, something alchemical occurs: the solid becomes spectral, the container becomes a cathedral of light. When light glows from within, it does not illuminate the amphora but dissolves it. The vessel that once held things now holds only radiance, as if the memories of a thousand voyages have kindled into light. It is both relic and revelation: its voids are not absences, but openings where the past breathes into the present. A paradox of presence and absence—not an amphora at all, but the idea of one, burning at its core.

---

## 13. RIPPLE
**Dimensions:** 7cm depth x 200 cm diameter | **Year:** 2024

From the *Waterdrop* series, *Ripple* represents a fusion of art and science, manifested in a transparent sculpture crafted from over 15,000 small metal bars. Designed in the form of a water ripple in high-gloss lacquered raw metal, it symbolizes the interconnectedness of the quantum realm with our tangible reality. Inspired by the double-slit experiment, the sculpture delves into the profound mysteries of quantum physics, showcasing how diverse waves converge and diverge to shape existence. *Ripple* invites viewers to contemplate the refined, enigmatic nature of the primordial energies that create our reality.

---

## 14. ICHOR
**Dimensions:** 7cm depth x 200 cm diameter (2024) / 20 cm depth x 250 cm x 120 cm (2022)

A wall relief from the *Waterdrop* series, *Ichor* is rusted with flames and hydrochloric acid—a specific chemical process similar to bronze patination. A mixture of high-gloss varnish and "mother of pearl" particles enhances the depth of the extracted color. The name originates in Greek mythology as the "ethereal fluid" that flows in the veins of the gods. While the *Persona* sculptures show the mask of the role we play, the *Waterdrop* series represents the opposite: primordial energy. Created in the same distinctive "net-work" manner, these works explore two extremes of the same principle.

---

## 15. IRON TAPESTRY
**Year:** 2022

A wall relief crafted from over 10,000 small metal bars. Embracing the essence of traditional wall art, *Iron Tapestry* exudes a powerful blend of strength and modernity. Its transparent form delicately weaves the background into its visual narrative, creating an individual piece of art that captivates the eye and transforms the wall into a participant in the work.

---

## 16. THE DANDELION
**Dimensions:** 190x110x110 cm / 110x100x190 cm | **Year:** 2024

The dandelion is a quiet philosopher of the ruins, a golden whisper born from cracks in the pavement. It does not ask for fertile ground; it transforms devastation into a cradle. Its roots split concrete, its leaves emerge from dust—a testament to life’s insistence on flourishing where it should not. To pluck it is futile; its seeds scatter on the wind, ensuring that even its destruction becomes genesis.

And yet we see the mirrored steel sculpture: cold, precise, its surface a flawless dance of light. It catches the sun like liquid silver, each curve a calculated surrender to form, each edge sharp enough to divide reality from reflection. It is delicate in its perfection, a thing meant to be admired but never touched. *The Dandelion* serves as a potent symbol of immortality through resilience, embodying the power found in surrender, transformation, and interconnectedness.

## THE AWAKENING (Artist Statement)
"In the timeless dance of humanity's narrative, my inspiration comes from the depths of philosophical, esoteric, and theological wisdom—wisdom that has guided our spirits through the ages. Myths, legends, folklore: they whisper of man's essence and his place in the grand tapestry of existence. Titans of the subconscious, ancient and new gods embodied in self-awareness, the masks we don in our ceaseless quest for enlightenment and purpose.

Amidst the eternal battle of form and concept, steel becomes not only a material but also a tool, crafting a tangible emblem that harbors a message encrypted in myriad layers: from symbolic shapes to veiled symmetries of number, measurement, and form. A language resonating with the essence of our shared human journey, encapsulating a universal human odyssey.

Through these sculptures, I seek to awaken the dormant, ancient spirit, resurrect the potency of age-old myths, and summon fortitude and vigor via a medium or symbol that stirs, elevates, and emboldens the human soul, serving as a poignant reminder of our towering stature as the erstwhile titans who once graced this earth."

— *Nikola Vudrag*

## 2. THE TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES

**Introductory Statement**
The 12 labors of Hercules are a journey of character formation—a cycle encompassing the entirety of the human personality. Hercules confesses he has slain his past teachers and stands free, yet the Teacher warns: "Again, you will meet the lion. Again, you will wrestle with desire." He is the candidate who must reconcile the spiritual and the earthly, the immortal and mortal brothers. This series explores that eternal dualism: our strength and our dilemma.

### 1. THE CRETAN BULL
**Dimensions:** 440 x 130 x 190 cm | **Year:** 2020 | **Collection:** Private
The Cretan Bull represents the ability to contain the realizing power of the luminous mind without artifice. From earliest antiquity, the bull stood as the guarantor of fertility—a symbol of the fertilizing power of the spirit and the creative force descending into matter.

### 2. GERYON CATTLE (The Tenth Labor)
**Dimensions:** 310 x 190 x 365 cm | **Year:** 2019 | **Location:** Jagić Park, Varaždin
Obtaining the Cattle of Geryon was the tenth labor—magnificent beasts with coats made red by the light of the sunset. Owned by Geryon, a triple-bodied giant, they represent the challenge of strength against the strongest of mortals. One bull escaped to the land now known as Italy (*Víteliú*—"land of bulls"), marking the landscape with its passage.

### 3. THE HIND OF CERYNEIA
**Dimensions:** 440 x 110 x 280 cm | **Year:** 2022
The Ceryneian Hind was no ordinary deer; enormous in stature and sacred to Artemis, capturing it required more than strength—it demanded devotion. Symbolizing the purification of the planes located above the intellect, this labor teaches that one who cares about purification must work in both registers: the mind and the gradual rejection of disturbances from the lower nature.

### 4. THE STYMPHALIAN BIRDS
**Dimensions:** 1200 x 500 x 300 cm (Installation) | **Year:** 2025 | **Collection:** Private
The birds represent the thoughts, closely related to the vital nature symbolized by the thick forests of Lake Stymphalia. They embody the layer of the human mental-physical that relies on the animal sensory mind—organizing experiences based on the pleasure/pain duality. This sculpture aims at extracting the root of that duality, capturing the moment of liberation from the sensory swarm.

### 5. THE STABLES (Augeas)
**Dimensions:** 600 x 900 x 1150 cm (Installation) | **Year:** 2022 | **Collection:** Private
Long after Hercules cleansed the stables of Augeas by diverting rivers, time left behind something strange: a great portal of rusted steel, half-sunken in the earth. The metal, pitted and scarred like ancient hide, strains to hold together some forgotten weight. Was it a ruin or a relic? The gate stands as a threshold where myth and relic intertwine—a reminder that no labor, however divine, ever fully disappears.

### 6. GARDENS OF THE HESPERIDES
**Dimensions:** S/M/L up to 200 cm | **Year:** 2024 | **Event:** Malta Biennale
Eurystheus ordered Hercules to retrieve the golden apples from the garden of the Hesperides, located in the Hyperboreans’ land on the Atlas. These apples symbolize Knowledge whose limits constantly recede as human evolution progresses. To possess them is to have access to Truth—vision of causes and consequences. This labor is about the indefinite extension of consciousness, reaching toward the exit from time and space as we know them.

### 7. APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES (Sculptural Interpretation)
A sculptural interpretation of the ancient legend: apples guarded by Atlas at the northern edge of the world. Esoterically, they transcend material existence, becoming symbols of spiritual enlightenment. Hercules’ labor becomes a metaphor for the hero’s inner journey—a pursuit of wisdom and the cultivation of virtues that elevate the human spirit.

## 3. POLYGONAL & MYTHOLOGICAL

### ATLAS AND PROMETHEUS
**Dimensions:** 100 x 100 x 350 cm each | **Year:** 2024 | **Event:** 60th Venice Biennale
Depicted as hands experiencing opposing forces, these sculptures carry both physical and symbolic weight. **Atlas**—a hand emerging from the ground gripping a pillar—symbolizes the force of pushing, the tremendous pressure to uphold civilization's ideals. **Prometheus**—a hand being pulled by a chain—represents the force of pulling, the struggle of rebellion and the pursuit of knowledge against oppressive constraints. Together, they highlight the duality of human existence: the burden we carry and the desire for freedom.

### POSEIDON, THE OLYMPIAN
**Dimensions:** 400 x 330 x 180 cm | **Year:** 2022 | **Location:** Biograd n/m
The sculpture's trident is lifted towards the sea, symbolizing Poseidon's power over the waters, while his outstretched arm suggests the calming of an incoming storm. The rusted patina of CorTen steel adds a timeless, weathered look, while the use of metal polygon plates introduces a modern geometric precision to the mythic form.

### THE ILLUMINATED CONCEPT (Diamond)
**Dimensions:** 60x80x80 cm – 160x200x200 cm
A CorTen steel sculpture of a diamond with open edges, emanating light from within. It represents the transformation of ideas into tangible reality. During the day, it stands as a representation of potential and strength; at night, the glowing core serves as a metaphor for the Platonic idea that radiates from within—proof of the transformative power of creativity.

### MUSK OX & RHINO
* **The Musk Ox (2019):** Standing on a vineyard estate on Pelješac, its patina is carefully crafted to contrast with the green environment. *230 x 360 x 190 cm.*
* **The Rhino (2018):** A tribute to Sudan, the last white rhino—a minimalistic symbol of hope and a call to action for conservation. *330 x 150 x 170 cm.*

### DIAMOND COLLECTION / COP28 (2023)
The patina on CorTen diamond sculptures carries an organic hue that complements modern landscapes, suggesting stability and endurance. For **COP28: The Seven Realms**, large black diamonds were constructed in proportions corresponding to the UAE regions, coated in "galactic black"—a recipe containing pearls, iron oxide, and metallic particles.

## 4. PUBLIC WORKS & INTERVENTIONS

### TOMISLAVUS REX CROATORUM
**Dimensions:** 600 x 550 x 210 cm | **Year:** 2025 | **Location:** Varaždin
A thought-provoking modern interpretation of Croatia's first king, King Tomislav. This monumental piece depicts the head of the king in a fragmented, ruin-like manner—as if the remains of a once-majestic monument. It speaks to the cyclical nature of history, the passage of time, and the resilience of cultural memory. Erected for the 1100th anniversary of his coronation (925–2025).

### THE VIOLIN (Music)
**Dimensions:** 400 x 200 x 180 cm | **Year:** 2020 | **Location:** Varaždin
Made from steel and bolts resembling the construction style of the Eiffel Tower, *The Violin* features playable strings. The sculpture has four notes that any viewer can play, creating a truly interactive experience where engineering meets sound.

### TESLA POWER LINE
**Dimensions:** 12m x 5m x 4.5m | **Year:** 2020 | **Location:** Varaždin Tech Park
A monument to Nikola Tesla in the form of an electrical power line. This 12-meter sculpture is a smaller version of an imagined functional power line, converting functional industrial structures into aesthetic and conceptual artistic forms.

### GATES OF PURGATORY
**Dimensions:** 3m x 1.2m x 10cm | **Year:** 2020 | **Location:** Palmižana
A minimalistic art intervention at the publicly open resort Palmižana. In a large iron gate, a water curtain is installed; every passerby walks through the water, integrating the object harmoniously into the botanical surroundings.

### PLASMA TORCH ART
In this raw, elemental work, industry and humanity collide. The 2mm CorTen steel plate, cold and unyielding, gives way to an absence that speaks louder than presence: the silhouette of a hand, or complex designs drawn with fire. The torch does not sculpt; it reveals by removal—a paradox of creation through destruction.
