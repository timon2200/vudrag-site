NET-WORK
Vudrag's recognizable fusion of small
metal bars welded in irregular geometric
patterns transcends mere construction to
become a organic growth of form. With a
staggering assembly from 4000 up to
20,000 individual elements, each piece is
meticulously crafted through a laborious
process, welding one piece after another.
This method, akin to a meditative journey,
requires immense patience, unwavering
persistence, and sheer determination. The
result is a series of sculptures, each
boasting a distinctive pattern that sets it
apart as a singular work of art,
unachievable through replication. The
intricate patterns and unique forms that
emerge from this process beckon
observers to pause and contemplate. The
interplay of light and shadow on the
welded metal bars creates a dynamic
visual experience, inviting onlookers to
explore the depths of each piece.

The word "person" comes from the
Latin persona (from the Greek
prosōpon), meaning mask, as in
the mask worn by actors on the
classical stage.
The “Persona” series of works
presents the human personality.
The long CorTen rods are cut to
the measure of three centimeters,
and each of them is welded
together again in the form of a
net. Each “Persona” contains 3000-
5000 small rods and they are
chemically rusted and protected
with a high gloss varnish.
A “person”
, then, in its original
meaning, is neither the player, nor
the living human being, but rather
the role played.

The face emerges from a web
of iron bars, stern, noble, frozen
in the rigid geometry. The more
we study its lines, the more it
escapes us; the harder we seek
its humanity, the more it
becomes pure structure.
What is a “Persona”? Perhaps
all identity is a kind of cage,
the bars of lineage, of history,
of the roles we are forged into.
The sculpture does not ask to
be known, only to be
witnessed. It is both mask and
revelation, and its hollow eyes
reminding us that every face
we see, even our own is a
scaffold of perceptions,
waiting to be dismantled. The
mask in a play where no one
knows the actor.
120 x 90 x 40 cm, 2023.
THE RELIC
Before us stands a face, universal,
classical, a relic of antiquity. Its form
is familiar: the noble brow, the
composed lips, the gaze that seems
to look through time. It is both
presence and absence. The face is
there, yet we see through it, its
substance is openness, its solidity an
illusion of intersecting lines.
Tradition, too, is like this: a structure
we perceive as whole, yet it is only
a framework built from countless
fragments of thought, belief, and
memory. The steel does not hide its
making; every weld is visible, every
joint a testament to labor. So too is
tradition forged, not born pristine,
but assembled, contested, and
reshaped. The face endures not
despite its transparency, but
because of it. It is a relic that
refuses to be static, a symbol that
admits its own construction.

This matte black face sculpture
composed of delicately welded
metal bars, forms an organic mesh
that plays with perception and
presence. The intricate meshwork
creates a semi-transparent effect,
allowing the white wall behind to
become an active participant:
shadows and light weaving through
the voids to complete the portrait.
The interplay of solid and empty
space challenges the boundaries of
form, making the sculpture appear
both tangible and ephemeral. As
the ambient light shifts, so does the
expression, inviting viewers to
contemplate the elusive nature of
identity and the unseen forces that
shape it. A dialogue between
material and absence, this piece
transforms the wall into a canvas of
fleeting impressions.

This arresting face, densely formed
from metal bars, carries a striking
duality: both fortress and figure. The
steel is layered, welded with such
intensity that the negative spaces
nearly vanish, as if the material itself
has coalesced into a protective
mask. Heavy, raw, and unyielding, it
speaks of resilience, yet the contours
flow with an unexpected grace,
softening into something almost
tender.
Here, metal is more than material; it
becomes persona, a shield guarding
the unseen vitality within. The contrast
between rugged industrial weight
and delicate human form invites
contemplation: What lies behind this
armored visage? Perhaps the answer
is not in the steel, but in the quiet
energy it contains.
120 x 90 x 40 cm, 2025.
T H E P R E S E N C E
With this work Vudrag challenges the
very nature of perception through an
intricate sculpture composed of
25,000 individually welded metal
bars. These delicate strands coalesce
into a transparent veil, an ethereal
mesh that simultaneously conceals
and reveals the soft, graceful
contours of a face. The visage
emerges not as a solid form, but as
an elusive suggestion, a play of light
and shadow. The veil itself cascades
downward like a metaphysical
drapery, both masking and mapping
the anatomy beneath. Here we
recognize the face, yet it does not
truly exist. It is an illusion, a mental
projection shaped by the structure
that frames it. In this way, the piece
transcends its materiality, becoming
a contemplative space where
presence is defined by absence.

This metal sculpture evokes the
organic complexity of the Amazon’s
tangled branches and winding
rivers. The dark, rusted patina
carries the weight of time, as if
shaped by centuries of natural
erosion. Two distinct yet harmonious
forms emerge; flowing like water,
branching like trees, converging
into a visage that feels both
ancient and alive.
Though the two halves never touch,
their interplay suggests an
unbroken connection, a silent
dialogue between land and river,
past and present. Mounted as a
wall relief, the piece becomes a
fragment of a larger, unseen
landscape, inviting contemplation
on the enduring forces of nature
and the fragile balance within it.

“Eye” from the “Fragments”
series embody the idea that
beauty and meaning can
emerge from brokenness and
imperfection. These fragmented
compositions evoke a sense of
resilience, transformation, and
encourages a closer look,
revealing intricate details and
hidden connections that might
otherwise go unnoticed. It is a
celebration of the imperfect, the
incomplete, and the beautifully
imperfect nature of existence.

The “Kiss” is a wall relief from the "Fragments" series, crafted from 1,000 to 1,200 metal elements. It is available in
three distinct finishes: metallic shine, patinated rust, and matte rust. The piece explores the timeless theme of love
and romance, and as a parallel to the "Persona" series,
"Kiss" delves deeper into the complexities of identity and
human emotions, making it a significant addition to contemporary art discussions.

The sphere is a symbol of perfection:
eternal, whole, a shape without
beginning or end. Yet the artist
constructs it from slender metal bars,
they do not seek to capture its
flawless form, but to reveal its hidden
truth: that wholeness is an illusion, a
fragile harmony of fragments. Each
bar is a decision, a limitation, a
defiance of the infinite curve. The
gaps between them are not
absences, but invitations for light to
pass, and for the eye to complete
what the hand left open. The artist
knows that to grasp the absolute is to
dissolve it; thus, he builds his sphere in
fragments, honoring the paradox that
only through imperfection can
perfection be glimpsed.

The sacred vessel of antiquity, born from
Mediterranean earth and fire, once
carried wine, oil, and the whispers of
forgotten voyages. But when the artist
reimagines it in welded metal bars,
something alchemical occurs: the solid
becomes spectral, the container
becomes a cathedral of light. And when
light glows from within it does not
illuminate the amphora, but dissolves it.
The vessel that once held things now
holds only radiance, as if the memories
of a thousand voyages have kindled into
the light.
The artist’s metal amphora is both relic
and revelation: its voids are not
absences, but openings where the past
breathes into the present. The light inside
is not trapped, but liberated. And so the
sculpture stands a paradox of presence
and absence. It is not an amphora at all,
but the idea of one, burning at its core.

From the "Waterdrop" series, ripple
represents a fusion of art and
science, manifested in a
transparent metal sculpture crafted
from over 15,000 small metal bars.
This intricate piece is designed in
the form of a water ripple, in high
gloss lacquered raw metal,
symbolizing the interconnectedness
of the quantum realm with our
tangible reality. Inspired by the
renowned double-slit experiment,
the sculpture delves into the
profound mysteries of quantum
physics, showcasing how diverse
quantum waves converge and
diverge to shape the fabric of our
existence. Through its mesmerizing
design and intricate construction,
"Ripple" invites viewers to
contemplate the enigmatic nature
of quantum mechanics and the
profound influence of these
primordial energies that create life
and our reality.

The next wall relief from the
“Waterdrop” series, rusted with
flames and hydrochloric acid,
Vudrag’s specific chemical process
similar to bronze patination. In the
preservation process a mixture of
high gloss varnish and “mother of
pearl” particles are used to
enhance the depth of extracted
color of the material. The name of
the sculpture originates in Greek
mythology as the "ethereal fluid"
.
While in “Persona” sculptures the
person is shown as the mask of the
role we play in life, the energy
focused in the human role, the
“Waterdrop” represents the
absolute opposite: the primordial
energy. Considering the fact that
these series of works show two
extremes of the same principle,
they are created in the same “net-
work” manner, author’s distinctive
style of welding small rods into a
semi-transparent net form.

The dandelion is a quiet philosopher of the ruins, a
golden whisper born from cracks in the pavement,
from trampled earth, from the choked aftermath of
fire. It does not ask for fertile ground; it transforms
devastation into a cradle. Its roots split concrete, its
leaves emerge from dust, each one a testament to
life’s insistence on flourishing where it should not. To
pluck it is futile; its seeds scatter on the wind, ensuring
that even its destruction becomes genesis. The
dandelion is not fragile; it is the defiance of fragility, a
paradox of softness and indomitability.
And yet we see the mirrored steel sculpture, cold,
precise, its surface a flawless dance of light. It
catches the sun like liquid silver, each curve a
calculated surrender to form, each edge sharp
enough to divide reality from reflection. It is delicate
in its perfection, a thing meant to be admired but
never touched.

“THE DANDELION” carries profound
symbolism in various cultures, representing
concepts such as resilience, hope, and
transformation. His ability to produce
numerous seeds that are easily carried by
the wind symbolizes the idea of life
continuing beyond a single organism.
Even when the plant is uprooted, its seeds
can take root elsewhere, representing the
enduring nature of life and the cycle of
rebirth.
The dandelion serves as a potent symbol
of immortality through its resilience and
ability to propagate, while also
embodying the power found in surrender,
transformation, and interconnectedness.
Its lessons encourage us to embrace
change, let go of what no longer serves us,
and recognize the enduring nature of life
itself.

Welded steel patterns 1: SHIELD NET-WORK-ING
Dense, deliberate, and unyielding, these works transform welded steel rods into armored surfaces, a mesh so
tightly fused it becomes a metallic hide. Gaps appear only as calculated negative space, while the relentless
overlap of rods creates an almost impenetrable texture. The craftsmanship is severe: raw grinding polishes the
surface to a reflective sheen, while strategic torch burns pull forth hidden hues: deep blues, violets, and golds,
seared into the steel’s core. The METALLIC finish catches light like blade edges, but in DARK SILVER finish where the
torch lingers, the fire liberates its inner spectrum. This is welding as alchemy: force and precision transmuting rigid
rods into a radiant, resilient skin.
Welded steel patterns 2: BRUT NET-WORK-ING
Raw, unrefined, and charged with the force of creation, these works embrace the brutal beauty of welded steel
in its most visceral state. Metal rods surging outward in chaotic yet deliberate formations, their paths scorched by
the torch, their joints scarred by visible welds. The RUSTED variants, eaten by oxidation, appear as unearthed
artifacts, crumbling yet enduring. The TORCH BLACKENED and SILVER versions preserve the rawness of their
making, with splattered beads and heat-warped textures laid bare. Matte finishes absorb light like aged steel,
while high-gloss lacquer seals the raw force beneath a glassy veneer, turning fury into monument. This is welding as
archaeology: each piece a relic of force, time, and transformation.
Welded steel patterns 3: ORGANIC NET-WORK-ING
This series captures the dynamic energy and flow from a single focal point (or sometimes more), branching
outward in organic patterns as if shaped by unseen currents. The artist leaves gravity to guide the material into
flowing, almost botanical forms, where each weld becomes a joint in an evolving metallic organism. Available in
two distinct finishes, the works oscillate between raw vitality and refined elegance: the RUST version, treated with
oxidizing chemicals, mimics the weathered beauty of driftwood or coral. The SILVER and DARK SILVER variants
evoke the sleek tension of molten rivers frozen in time. Both interpretations can be rendered in matte (soft, organic)
or high-gloss (liquid, luminous) finishes, amplifying either the piece’s earthy tactility or its sculptural fluidity.
Welded steel patterns 4: SUMERAN NET-WORK-ING
This series of welded metal patterns reinterprets the ancient elegance of Sumerian cuneiform through
contemporary fabrication techniques. By fusing slender steel rods into intricate mesh patterns, the artist transforms
industrial material into a lyrical exploration of form and texture. Two distinct finishes offer contrasting expressions: a
richly textured RUST version, achieved through controlled chemical oxidation, evokes archaeological fragments
steeped in time. Alternatively, the SILVER and DARK SILVER variants treated with precise torch work present a sleek,
modern duality, available in both matte and high-gloss finishes. The latter catches light like liquid metal, while the
former absorbs it, deepening the geometric shadows.
THE AWAKENING
"In the timeless dance of humanity's narrative,
my inspiration comes from the depths of
philosophical, esoteric, and theological wisdom
that has guided our spirits through the ages.
Myths, legends, folklore: they whisper of man's
essence and his place in the grand tapestry of
existence. Titans of the subconscious, ancient
and new gods embodied in self-awareness, the
masks we don, with our ceaseless quest for
enlightenment and purpose.
Amidst the eternal battle of form and concept,
steel becomes not only a material but also a
tool, crafting a tangible emblem that harbors a
message encrypted in myriad layers: from
symbolic shapes to veiled symmetries of
number, measurement, and form, a language
resonating with the essence of our shared
human journey, encapsulating a universal
human odyssey.
Through these sculptures, I seek to awaken the
dormant, ancient spirit, resurrect the potency of
age-old myths, summon fortitude and vigor via
a medium or symbol that stirs, elevates, and
emboldens the human soul, serving as a
poignant reminder of our towering stature as
the erstwhile titans who once graced this earth.

THE TWELVE LABORS OF HERCULES
In the story of Hercules, the 12
labors are a journey of
character formation. The
symbolic nature of the number
12 in this story lies in its
representation of a complete
cycle encompassing the
entirety of the human
personality.
Hercules confesses that he has
slain all his past teachers, he
stands free and self determining.
He boasts of his feats and wears
the skin of the lion he slew at
eighteen. The Teacher warns
‘Again, you will meet the lion.
Again, the teachers whom you
slew will cross your path. Again,
will you wrestle with desire’
, for
he has yet to prove himself and
earn his place among the
Olimpians.
Hercules as ‘the candidate’
stands before the Teacher who
asks his name. Herakles,
meaning ‘Heras glory.
’ Hera
stands for Psyche or soul, which
he is yet to reveal. What is the
soul? he asks his Teacher, who
replies ‘this you will discover as
you do your task’
. He is asked
his parentage.
‘My father is
divine I know him not, but I
know I am his son. My mother I
know well she made me what I
am.
’ He adds that he is a twin,
he has another self. So, here he
states the underlying theme of
apparent dualism that is the
human condition, our strength
and our dilemma – how to
reconcile the spiritual and the
earthly, the immortal and
mortal brothers, Castor and
Pollux, Romulus and Remus,
Cain and Abel… the seemingly
eternal dualism.

THE CRETAN BULL
The Cretan Bull that Heracles
must bring back alive
represents the ability to
contain without artifice the
realizing power of the
luminous mind. According to
some, this bull is the one
which took Europe to Crete,
Zeus having taken this
appearance or the bull simply
having been sent by the god.
From the earliest antiquity,
the bull represented the
guarantor of fertility. It is the
symbol of the fertilizing power
of the spirit, of the principle
generating the New, of the
descent of the Divine
consciousness and its force in
matter and thus, by
extension, of the realising and
creative ability.

Obtaining the Cattle of
Geryon was the tenth task
allocated to Heracles by King
Eurystheus. The cattle were
magnificent beasts, with coats
made red by the red-light of
the sunset; the danger in the
task though, was the fact that
the cattle were owned by
Geryon, a triple bodied giant,
a giant described as the
strongest of all mortals by
Hesiod.
At the place now known as
Reggio di Calabria, one of the
cattle managed to escape
from the care of Heracles, and
as it made its way across the
country the land was called
after it, for that land was Italy,
and its name probably comes
from Víteliú, the “land of bulls”
.

THE HIND OF CERYNEIA
The Ceryneian Hind was a
deer said to reside in the
region of Ceryneia upon the
Peloponnese. The Ceryneian
Hind though was no ordinary
deer, for it was enormous in
size and stature, and often
compared in size to a large
bull.
The Ceryneian Hind which
Heracles must bring back
alive symbolizes the
purification of the planes
located above the intellect.
Thus, one who cares about
purification must work in both
registers, that of the
purification of the mind and
that of the gradual rejection
of the disturbances coming
from the lower nature.

THE STYMPHALIAN BIRDS
The birds represent the
thoughts, closely related to the
vital, which is symbolized by
the thick forests along the lake
Stymphalia. It is therefore
question of the layer of the
human mental physical that
relies on the animal sensory
mind. That animal mind, still
present within man even
though it has largely been
controlled over thousands of
years, has accompanied the
development of animal life,
allowing it to organize sensory
experiences based on the
pleasure/pain duality.
The labour of the Stymphalian
Birds ultimately aims at
extracting the root of duality in
the physical mental which is
based on sensory mind.

Long after Hercules cleansed
the stables of Augeas by
diverting rivers, washing away
the weight of ages, time, ever
disobedient, left behind
something strange: a great
portal of rusted steel, half-sunken
in the earth. The metal, left to
the rain and wind, had taken on
the texture of ancient hide,
pitted and scarred. Triangular
reinforcements crisscrossed its
frame, as if the structure itself
were straining to hold together
some forgotten weight. Was it a
ruin or a relic? A marker of
triumph or a reminder that no
labor, however divine, ever fully
disappears? The gate stood,
neither monument nor tomb,
but something in between; a
threshold where myth and relic
intertwined.

THE GARDENS OF THE HESPERIDES
Eurystheus ordered Heracles to
bring him back the golden
apples of the Hesperides, a
garden which was located in
the Hyperboreans’ land on the
Atlas. These golden apples
symbolize the Knowledge
whose limits are constantly
receding as human evolution
progresses.
To have the knowledge is to
have access at each moment
in consciousness to all the
elements necessary to action
in Truth, including the vision of
its causes and of its
consequences. This labor is
about progressing towards an
indefinite extension of
consciousness, in width and in
depth, to the exit from time
and space as we know them..

THE APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES
A sculptural interpretation of the
ancient legend: the apples that
were kept in a garden at the
northern edge of the world, and
they were guarded by Atlas, the
Titan who held the sky and the
earth upon his shoulders.
Esoterically, the Apples of the
Hesperides transcend their
material existence, becoming
symbols of spiritual enlightenment
and the quest for higher
knowledge. Hercules’ labor to
retrieve these coveted apples
becomes a metaphor for the
hero’s inner journey, a pursuit of
wisdom, illumination, and the
cultivation of virtues that elevate
the human spirit. This labor
beckons individuals to partake in
the Herculean quest for inner
enlightenment and the golden
fruits of self-discovery.
ATLAS AND PROMETHEUS
The sculptures of Atlas
and Prometheus,
depicted as hands
experiencing
opposing forces, carry
both physical and
symbolic meanings. In
terms of physics, the
sculptures represent
two fundamental
forces: pushing and
pulling. Atlas's hand
under pressure
symbolizes the force
of pushing, while
Prometheus's hand
being pulled by a
chain represents the
force of pulling.
ATLAS
The sculpture represents Atlas,
depicted as a hand emerging from the
ground and gripping a classical pillar.
The artwork is designed to convey the
impression of the hand exerting
upward force while simultaneously
experiencing significant pressure. This
juxtaposition symbolizes the strength
and burden associated with the
mythical figure of Atlas, who carried
the weight of the world on his
shoulders. The symbolism of the pillar in
the sculpture goes beyond its
representation of various qualities. It
also signifies the tremendous pressure
and expectations placed upon Atlas to
uphold and preserve those qualities in
the face of changing trends and
influences in the world. This symbolism
underscores the continuous effort
required to maintain and protect the
ideals and principles that shape our
civilization

The story of Prometheus represents
defiance of old systems, knowledge,
and the consequences of challenging
the gods. When we relate this
mythology to sculpture, mathematics
plays a significant role: THE stability
and strength due to GEOMETRIC
inherent structural integrity. Those
mathematical concepts of the
structure are often used in Vudrag
artistic forms to provide stability and
resist external forces, including gravity.
On the other hand, Prometheus, who is
bound by a chain and has his hand
pulled, represents rebellion, liberation,
and the pursuit of knowledge. His hand
being pulled symbolizes the tension
and struggle against societal
constraints, oppressive systems, or
limitations imposed by authority.

Together, these
sculptures highlight the
duality of human
existence. They capture
the contrasting forces
and tensions that
shape our lives, ranging
from the burdens we
carry to the desire for
freedom and the
pursuit of progress. By
juxtaposing these
opposing forces, the
sculptures contemplate
upon the complexities
of the human condition
and the interplay
between individual
agency and external
influences.
POSEIDON, THE OLYMPIAN
The sculpture's trident is lifted
towards the sea, symbolizing
Poseidon's power over the
waters. His left arm is
outstretched, suggesting the
movement of calming the
incoming storm. The details of
the sculpture are intricately
crafted, with every line and
curve carefully carved.
The rusted patina of CorTen
steel adds to the sculpture's
beauty, giving it a timeless
and weathered look that
complements its subject
matter. The use of metal
polygon plates in the
sculpture's construction adds
a modern touch to an
otherwise timeless piece of
art.

The CorTen steel sculpture of
a diamond with open edges,
emanating light from within,
represents the transformation
of ideas into tangible reality.
By juxtaposing the raw steel
form with an illuminated core,
the sculpture symbolizes the
process of refining and
bringing forth abstract
concepts into the physical
realm.
During the day, the sculpture
stands as a representation of
potential and strength,
resembling an oversized
diamond. At night, the
glowing core within the steel
structure serves as a
metaphor for the Platonistic
idea that radiates from within,
showcasing the
transformative power of ideas
and creativity.
TOMISLAVUS REX CROATORUM
The sculpture of King Tomislav is a thought-
provoking modern interpretation of Croatia's first
king, blending historical reverence with
contemporary artistic expression. This monumental
piece, measuring 6 meters in length and spanning
50 square meters, depicts the head of King
Tomislav, presented in a fragmented, ruin-like
manner, as if it were the remains of a once
majestic monument to the revered monarch.
The sculpture's imposing scale and dramatic
presentation invite viewers to reflect on the
historical significance of King Tomislav and the
enduring impact of his reign. By presenting the
king's head as a ruin, the artwork also speaks to
the cyclical nature of history, the passage of time,
and the resilience of cultural memory. It is a
poignant tribute to the king who laid the
foundations for the Croatian state, while also
serving as a modern artistic statement about the
fragility and permanence of historical legacy.
Located in a prominent public
space, the Center of Exelence for
National History, the sculpture of
King Tomislav has become a
cultural landmark, drawing both
locals and visitors to contemplate
its meaning and the story it tells.
Erected for the 1100th anniversary
of the Coronation of King Tomislav
(925.
- 2025.) it is not only a
celebration of Croatia's medieval
past but also a powerful symbol of
the nation's ability to preserve and
reinterpret its history through art.
The sculpture stands as a
testament to the enduring spirit of
King Tomislav and the timeless
connection between Croatia's
past and present.

City of Varaždin
The "Violin" is a sculpture that
stands in the city of Varaždin,
Croatia. Made from steel and bolts,
it resembles the construction style
of the famous Eiffel Tower.
One of the most unique features of
this sculpture is its playable strings.
The sculpture has four notes that
any viewer can play, allowing for a
truly interactive and engaging
experience.
The sculpture is a true collision of
engineering and design.
Whether you are a music lover or
simply appreciate art, this sculpture
is a must-see. Its unique design and
interactive nature makes it one of
the most special and memorable
sculptures in Varaždin.

POTRAITS AND PUBLIC FIGURES
Vudrag is often commissioned by the
State or public institutions to portray
public figures in bronze. Among
them are several portraits of the first
Croatian president placed in public
spaces throughout Croatia, or
historical figures who have
contributed in some way to the
welfare of a region, country, or
society.
(J.R.R. Tolkien in clay)
THE UNBREAKABLE
One of such portraits has a direct link
to the net-work series where the
face is remodeled and cast in the
author's blend of carbon, concrete,
and cement, then polished to a high
gloss. The piece "The Unbreakable"
,
shaped as the unbreakable mask,
symbolizes the portrait of Hypatia of
Alexandria, a renowned scientist
and pioneer in mathematics,
astronomy, and philosophy.

A TESTAMENT TO THE TRADITION
The "Musk Ox" sculpture made from
metal polygons is located on the
beautiful vineyard estate on Pelješac.
The sculpture was designed to fit the
spot, with the ox overlooking the south
of the vineyard. One of the most
striking features of the "Musk Ox"
sculpture is the beautiful patina of
CorTen steel that covers its surface. The
patina has been carefully crafted to
create a contrast with the green
environment of the vineyard, making
the sculpture stand out even more. The
rust-like appearance of the patina
gives the sculpture a sense of age and
history, while the use of modern
materials and techniques ensures that
it looks right at home in its actual
setting.

The rhino sculpture is a tribute to Sudan, the last white rhino who passed away in 2018. This
sculpture serves as a reminder of the importance of conservation and the need to protect
endangered species. The sculpture is a symbol of hope for the future and a call to action for
people to take responsibility for the environment. Its minimalistic design is a testament to the idea
that less is more, and it is a perfect enrichment for any collection of art.
EMBRACING INDIVIDUALITY
Commissioning a custom
sculpture is a way to bring
individuality to a public or private
space, or to make a more
personal bond with your art.
Whether you want to
commemorate a significant
event or memorialize a special
idea, a custom sculpture is an
ideal way to pay tribute, either in
private or public, like a sculpture
park or garden.
Commissioning a sculpture from an artist can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Once
you have agreed upon the terms of the commission, the artist will begin to create the sculpture.
Depending on the complexity of the project, this may take several weeks or months.
Commissioning a sculpture can be a rewarding experience that results in a unique and
personalized work of art. By approaching the process with careful consideration and clear
communication, you can ensure that you receive a piece that you will treasure for years to come.
DIAMOND COLLECTION
Patina on CorTen
diamonds sculptures carries
an important visual appeal
to the artwork. The
colouration of weathering
steel turns into an organic
and attractive hue that
complements the modern
landscape. The warm,
natural shades of brown
and orange suggest
stability, permanence, and
endurance, all of which are
desirable traits in modern
sculpture.
The design of the CorTen
steel diamonds brings
together the natural
beauty of the form with the
strength and durability of
CorTen steel.
DRAWING WITH PLASMA TORCH
Plasma hand-cutting art is the
process of cutting raw metal
sheets using a handheld
plasma torch to create
detailed and complex designs.
Wall metal art with light
installation is an innovative
and modern way to display
art. These installations usually
feature LED lights, which
enhance the artwork by
adding a warm and exotic
glow.
min 150 x 90 cm
max 300 x 150 cm
In this raw, elemental work, industry and humanity collide. The 2mm Corten steel plate, cold and
unyielding, marked by the searing passage of the plasma torch, gives way to an absence that
speaks louder than presence: the silhouette of a hand. Muscular, poised, charged with latent
force, it is at once tool and testament, a primal symbol carved not by addition but by removal.
Here, the artist does not sculpt; he reveals. The hand emerges from what is taken away, a
paradox of creation through destruction. The rough, burnt edges bear witness to human
intervention, yet the void they frame is timeless, an echo of the first grasp, the first act of making.
And here, we find only one tool, neither created nor invented, but perfect: the hand of man.

Vudrag embarked on his artistic journey by specializing in the intricate and rare profession of
medal design, showcasing his talent as a medalist. Despite his grander projects, his coin
prototypes, each no taller than 1.2mm in relief, are skillfully engraved in negative forms. His
expertise lies in crafting microrealism and hyperrealism, with subjects ranging from detailed
portraits to architectural marvels, delicate flora and fauna, and abstract designs. Vudrag's skill
and attention to detail have earned him the esteemed title of an "A1" class medalist globally,
solidifying his reputation as a master of his craft in the world of medal and coin design.

Nikola Vudrag is an artist who has made a name for himself in the world of
art through his metal sculptures. Born in 1989 in Croatia, Vudrag was drawn
to the arts at a very young age, working alongside his father and
grandfather who were both metalworkers. He enrolled in the Academy of
Applied Arts in Rijeka, Croatia, where he honed his skills in various art forms,
including painting, sculpture, and graphic design. After his studies in Rijeka,
Vudrag continued his education at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts. In his
final year, Vudrag had the opportunity to study abroad at the Anhalt
University of Applied Science in Germany. His work is characterized by its
intricate details and monumental designs where he incorporates elements
of geometry, mathematics, and physics into his sculptures. He draws
inspiration from philosophical, theological and mythological ideas, which he
weaves into his sculptures, giving them deeper meaning and significance.
Although he made a lot of memorial monuments, busts, portraits, medals,
Croatian national circulating and commemorative coins, he also exhibited
in various galleries mostly in Paris and around Europe. He had the
opportunity to work on large-scale projects, which helped him to develop his
skills in creating monumental sculptures.
He has had over 60 exhibitions, including notable ones such as his first
solo exhibition at the County Palace in 2005, the “International Medal
Exhibition” at the Art Medal Federation in Sofia in 2014,
“Tesla Mind from
the Future” in Zagreb in 2017 and Budapest in 2019, a pop-up exhibition
at Jetex Dubai during the COP28 summit 2023, the first Malta Biennale
“Luginsland of Art” in 2024, and “ECC Personal Structures” during the 60th
Venice Biennale 2024. In the art field Vudrag was honored or awarded
with Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts commendation for the best student in
the 2011/2012 academic year, Varaždin County scholarship for gifted
students in the field of art 2012/2013, Varaždin Civil Guard honourary
citizen for the perseverance, creativity and innovation in contributing to
the City of Varaždin 2021, Croatian National Bank certificate of
executing the euro and cent circulation coins for the national side of the
Republic of Croatia 2023, and the “Visionary of the year”
, arts category
award for accomplishments in culture and society, Zagreb 2024.
“I was drawn to Nikola Vudrag’s art because of his intellectual approach. This kind of approach isn't necessarily a requirement for artists
or curators, but rather a matter of personal choice and sensibility. Nikola is incredibly dedicated and knowledgeable, particularly in his
use of mythological subjects to address contemporary issues such as stress and the burdens imposed by society and the resilience of
humanity. This approach adds depth to his work and elevates it to a global level.”
Tatiana Palinkasev, art curator and cultural producer from Metamorphosis Art Projects
“He is in the full creative power and energy of a mature sculptor with a distinctive and recognizable style. He contemplates the themes
and content of his works with exceptional depth and significant philosophical insight. The perfect technical line in the execution of the
exhibited sculptures gives the impression of monumentality and the sculptor's superiority. The artist leaves nothing to chance and refines
details to the finest degree: a byproduct of his years of working with medals and relief in miniature form.
“
Robert Kavazović Horvat, mag.hist.art criticism and conservation, Managing Director at Dzamonja Foundation
“Vudrag has not changed at all since the first interview, he continues to be full of enthusiasm, inexhaustible energy, self-confidence, and
conviction in his artistic mission. Unlike most introverted artists, Vudrag is extremely communicative, proactive, and eloquent, which has
greatly helped him establish contact with people of different backgrounds. This, along with his undeniable talent, has enabled his
success in the art world.
”
Mladen Pleše, journalist and art commentator at Telegram, former editor of Start, Vjesnik, Nacional, Globus, and Jutarnji list.
“Being in his creative space, I can genuinely describe him as a modern Renaissance man... Vudrag exudes excitement and passion for
working on large-scale monumental sculptures that stand out for their remarkable material quality, a testament to his profound
appreciation and understanding of metals. Moreover, he delves deep into exploring the relationship between the viewer, the work of
art, and its surrounding environment, creating a profound and immersive experience for anyone encountering his sculptures.
What distinguishes Vudrag from many other sculptors is his unique perspective on the impact of his art on people's lives. While some
artists might be offended by an amorous couple memorializing their love on their works, I witnessed Vudrag's delight when he saw a
mark of love on the foot of his sculpture of Nikola Tesla. To him, it signifies that his art has become an integral part of people's lives,
evoking emotions and becoming a meaningful part of their stories.
