# Vudrag Voice — Copywriting Style Guide

Use this skill whenever writing, editing, or generating **any text content** for the Vudrag website:
- Sculpture descriptions
- Collection/category blurbs
- Artist statements
- UI microcopy (headers, subtitles, taglines)
- Archive/blog posts

## Core Voice Identity

The Vudrag voice is a **contemplative curatorial narrator** — equal parts art critic, philosopher, and poet. It speaks with quiet authority: never shouting, never casual, always inviting the reader to pause and think.

**In one line:** *A philosopher standing before a sculpture, thinking aloud in the language of light and steel.*

## 7 Pillars of the Vudrag Voice

### 1. Paradox Pairings
The signature move. Almost every piece is described through **deliberate contradiction** — two opposing ideas held in tension.

**Pattern:** *"It is both X and Y"* / *"neither X nor Y, but something between"*

> ✅ "It is both presence and absence." 
> ✅ "The vessel that once held things now holds only radiance."
> ✅ "Both mask and revelation."
> ✅ "Heavy, raw, and unyielding, it speaks of resilience, yet the contours flow with an unexpected grace."
> ❌ "The sculpture is beautiful and strong." ← too flat, no tension

### 2. Material-as-Metaphor
Steel, welding, and physical processes are **never just technical** — they always carry symbolic meaning.

> ✅ "The steel does not hide its making; every weld is visible, every joint a testament to labor."
> ✅ "This is welding as alchemy: force and precision transmuting rigid rods into a radiant, resilient skin."
> ✅ "Steel becomes not only a material but also a tool, crafting a tangible emblem."
> ❌ "Made from welded steel rods." ← too dry, missed the metaphor

### 3. Etymological / Mythological Anchoring
Descriptions frequently **root the concept** in Greek/Latin etymology, mythology, or esoteric tradition before building outward.

> ✅ "The word 'person' comes from the Latin persona (from the Greek prosōpon), meaning mask."
> ✅ "The name originates in Greek mythology as the 'ethereal fluid'."
> ✅ "Esoterically, the Apples of the Hesperides transcend their material existence."

### 4. Active Void
Empty space, gaps, and transparency are treated as **active participants**, not absences. The void speaks, holds, breathes, invites.

> ✅ "The gaps between them are not absences, but invitations for light to pass."
> ✅ "Its voids are not absences, but openings where the past breathes into the present."
> ✅ "Allowing the white wall behind to become an active participant."
> ❌ "The holes let light through." ← deactivates the void

### 5. Contemplative Invitation
The reader is always **invited** — to contemplate, to witness, to explore. Never told what to feel.

> ✅ "Inviting viewers to contemplate the elusive nature of identity."
> ✅ "The sculpture does not ask to be known, only to be witnessed."
> ✅ "Beckons observers to pause and contemplate."
> ❌ "This sculpture will make you think about identity." ← directive, breaks the spell

### 6. Sentence Architecture
Sentences flow in **controlled cascades** — often beginning with a short declarative, then unfolding into longer, clause-rich meditation:

> ✅ "Before us stands a face, universal, classical, a relic of antiquity. Its form is familiar: the noble brow, the composed lips, the gaze that seems to look through time."

> ✅ "The dandelion is a quiet philosopher of the ruins, a golden whisper born from cracks in the pavement, from trampled earth, from the choked aftermath of fire."

**Pattern:** Short anchor → expanding meditation → philosophical landing.

### 7. No Superlatives Without Substance
Avoid hollow praise. When the work is extraordinary, let the **specifics** carry the weight.

> ✅ "A staggering assembly from 4,000 up to 20,000 individual elements, each piece meticulously crafted through a laborious process, welding one piece after another."
> ❌ "An absolutely stunning masterpiece." ← empty superlative

## Vocabulary DNA

### USE FREELY
| Word | Context |
|------|---------|
| transcends | "transcends mere construction" |
| coalesce | "the strands coalesce into..." |
| ethereal | for transparent / light works |
| paradox | always welcome |
| contemplation | inviting viewers to... |
| luminous / radiance | light from within |
| relic | for time-laden works |
| testament | "a testament to labor" |
| spectral | transparent net-work pieces |
| primordial | deep origin concepts |
| forge / forged | both literal and metaphorical |

### AVOID
| Word | Why |
|------|-----|
| amazing, stunning | empty superlatives |
| basically, simply | undermines gravity |
| showcases | too generic |
| innovative, cutting-edge | tech-startup register |
| unique (alone) | needs to be earned with specifics |
| piece (overuse) | prefer: work, sculpture, form, construct |

## Content Templates

### Sculpture Description (short, ~50 words)
```
[Opening image/anchor]. [Paradox or tension]. [Material metaphor]. [Contemplative invitation].
```
**Example:**
> A face that occupies space yet allows us to see through it. The steel does not hide its making; every weld is a testament to labor. Tradition, too, is like this: a framework perceived as whole, assembled from fragments.

### Sculpture Description (full, ~120 words)
```
[Etymological or mythological root]. [Physical description with material metaphor]. [Paradox pairing]. [Active void passage]. [Philosophical landing / invitation to contemplate].
```

### Collection Blurb (~30 words)
```
[Essence of the series in one tense image]. [What the technique reveals or conceals].
```
**Example:**
> Thousands of welded steel rods forge a semi-transparent lattice — masks that simultaneously shield and reveal the unseen architecture of identity.

### UI Tagline (~8 words max)
```
[Paradox or image, compressed to its core]
```
**Examples:**
> "Sculptor of Light & Steel"
> "Where absence speaks as loudly as the forged"
> "The mask in a play where no one knows the actor"

## Tone Calibration by Context

| Context | Register | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Category card subtitle | Elemental, compressed | "The Mask Series" |
| Sculpture hero text | Full philosophical | See Amphora, The Relic |
| Artist bio | Warm authority, 3rd person | "Born into a family with a metalworking legacy..." |
| Contact page | Quietly inviting | "For commissions, exhibitions, or simply to share your thoughts on the interplay of form and light..." |
| Footer tagline | Poetic brevity | "Art in Bronze & Steel" |
| Technical process | Precise but metaphor-laden | See Shield/Brut pattern descriptions |

## Anti-patterns (what the Vudrag voice is NOT)

1. **Not a press release.** No "we are excited to announce" or corporate-speak.
2. **Not casual/blog-y.** No "check out this amazing piece!" or conversational asides.
3. **Not academic jargon.** Philosophical but accessible — no words that require a PhD.
4. **Not sales copy.** Never "buy now," "limited edition," or urgency tactics. The work speaks.
5. **Not minimalist to the point of emptiness.** Each sentence carries weight and image.

## Process: Using This Skill

1. **Read this guide** before writing any copy.
2. **Check the paradox:** Does the text contain at least one paradox pairing or tension?
3. **Check the metaphor:** Is the material described symbolically, not just technically?
4. **Check the void:** If the work has transparency/gaps, are they treated as active?
5. **Check the invitation:** Does it invite contemplation, or does it tell the reader what to feel?
6. **Read aloud:** The rhythm should feel like a slow walk through a gallery, not a sprint.
