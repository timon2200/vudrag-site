      "description": "Vudrag's signature technique involves welding thousands of short steel rods into organic lattices. Up to 20,000 welds are fused in what he describes as a \"ritual of attention.\"",
      "effect": "The resulting structures oscillate between solidity and void—appearing as dense mass in daylight and \"solidified mist\" when lit from within."
